=======================

The 30 second summary
=====================

L.I.S.A is:

* an intelligent system to help you in your daily life

* a framework to connect objects between them and expose a HTTP API

It was developed in order to have a "J.A.R.V.I.S" like interface (Iron Man).

The name come from "Weird Science" TV Show. Two nerds try to create the perfect
woman on their computer and one night she come to life. In France, this TV show
is named "Code LISA".

That's why this project has this name.

Building on proven technology
=============================

L.I.S.A takes advantage of a number of technologies and techniques. The
networking layer is built with the excellent `Twisted`_ networking
library.

L.I.S.A uses public keys for authentication to identify clients
allowed to connect.

The Web interface is built on top of `Django`_ which is a web framework
for python.
